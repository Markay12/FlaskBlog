## *Flask*
What is Flask?
- Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions

## *Objective*
Learn how to use flask and implement personal code into a new front-end environment

## *About Me*

My name is Mark Ashinhust and I am a Computer Systems Engineer at Arizona State University. I am in my second year and I am trying to expand what I know and be able to implement some of my backend code into this new frontend environment. This is a first from me and after following some guides I hope to be able to complete a project of this sort on my own.
