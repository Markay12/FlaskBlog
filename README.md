What is Flask?
- Flask is a framework that allows the user to take backend work and place it online into a front-end setup
- Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions
